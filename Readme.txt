This is a little RSA-Demonstation

it is not safe, so use it only for demonstration

the ./run script starts a server to recieve messages

well, ./startClient starts the client to send crypted messages to the server

The messages are devided into a lists of primes which will be crypted and send

the programm just runs on your local machine
